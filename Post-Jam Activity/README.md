  # 🚀 Post-Jam Activity: Build Your Portfolio Section
**GDG PUP HTML & CSS Study Jam 1**

Welcome to the Post-Jam Activity! This is a **boilerplate** project for you to practice what you've learned.

## 🎯 Your Mission

Your task is to **extend this portfolio** by adding **2 NEW SECTIONS**. 

**The twist? You decide what to build!** Choose topics that show off your personality.

### 💡 Project Ideas (Pick 2!)

Here are some suggestions to get you started, but feel free to invent your own:

*   **🎓 Education**: Show off your school, degree, and year level.
*   **🏆 Certifications**: List your awards, badges, or workshops (like this Study Jam!).
*   **📸 Photo Gallery**: A grid of your favorite photos, hobbies, or pets.
*   **🎵 Favorites**: A list of your top 3 movies, songs, games, or books.
*   **📝 Mini Blog**: A section with 2-3 short posts or updates.
*   **💬 Testimonials**: Nice things people have said about you.
*   **✈️ Travel Log**: Places you've visited or want to go.

### 🛠️ How to Do It

1.  **Edit `index.html`**:
    *   Scroll down to the **Post-Jam Activity** comment.
    *   Replace the placeholder sections (`#section-1`, `#section-2`) with your chosen topics.
    *   *Example*: Change `<section id="section-1">` to `<section id="favorites">`.
2.  **Edit `styles.css`**:
    *   Scroll to the bottom to the **Custom Styles** area.
    *   Style your new sections using their new IDs!
    *   *Example*:
        ```css
        #favorites {
            background-color: #fff0f5; /* Lavender blush */
            border-radius: 20px;
        }
        ```

## ✅ Success Criteria

How do you know you're done? Check if you have:

*   [ ] **Added 2 New Sections**: You have created two distinct sections with unique IDs.
*   [ ] **Personalized Content**: You replaced the placeholders with your own text and images.
*   [ ] **Styled Your Sections**: You used CSS to make them look good (backgrounds, borders, spacing).
*   [ ] **Theme Consistency**: You used the Google colors (`var(--google-blue)`, etc.) so it fits the rest of the site.
*   [ ] **Clean Code**: Your HTML is properly indented and your CSS is organized.

## 📂 File Structure
